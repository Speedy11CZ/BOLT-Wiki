# Contributing

This wiki is based on a collaborative concept of voluntary contributors.
If you have an idea for articles and don't have an account, contact `Speedy11CZ#0001` on discord.

## Rules for contributors
Contributors should follow the rules for adding contributions to the wiki:

1. Articles must be in English unless it is a quotation of the original text, which cannot be translated.
2. The text should not link to prohibited content such as malware or inappropriate sites.
3. If you add an article, check that its information is unique, which doesn't exist on the wiki.
4. If you are editing an already added article, do not remove useful information. Ideally, contact the original author.
5. Posts should not be off topic, they should be PlayStation related.

**The wiki admin always has the right to remove your account if you are not active or violating the rules.**

## Instructions for contributions
Here are some instructions and recommendations for quality contributions.

1. There are several different post editors to choose from. However, we recommend using markdown.
2. Contributions should be sufficiently informative.
3. If you quote some content, it is a good idea to add the source or a link.
